                    <p>Jack Shalenkova is a student at the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp. They have background as a visual specialist working as a photographer and retoucher (Adobe systems) and hold a B.A. in Photojournalism from Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In their spare time, Jack's hobbies include (but do not conclusively consist of) the following: 
                        <ul>
                            <li> bikes (the riding and fixing of) </li>
                            <li> books (the reading of) </li>
                            <li>music (the listening, playing, and attending shows of) </li> 
                            <li> WoW (the playing of) (as well as of indie games on their newly acquired Nintendo Switch) </li>
                            <li> photography (the activity of)</li>
                            <li> cats (the loving of) </li>
                            <li> thinking about how penguins are just fancy chickens (both are flightless dinosaur-birds prone to cannibalism)...</li>  
                        </ul>

                        Not much is known about Jack before their move to Philadelphia. While it is known that they were born and grew up in Saint Petersburg, Russia, their well-fitting regional accent and extensive knowledge of rude English expressions suggests an individual who has lived a lifetime in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Some evidence (such as Jack's dream of being the sole proprietor of a haberdashery and/or sewing notions shop) suggests a 19th century individual, but that would make Jack nearly 200 years old and that simply is not possible for 21st century medicine. What <em>is </em> known of "Jack" consists of the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Jack speaks Russian and English</li>
                                <li>Jack is a classically trained pianist</li>
                                <li>they despise the use of their dead name</li>
                                <li>they are sole guardian to a ten-year-old calico dilute named Cairo, who is very fat and half blind</li>
                                <li>they do not know the origin or purpose of commonly used phrase "stop drop and roll"</li>
                                <li>in their hubris they will stop at nothing (including harm of personal health) to complete a task</li>
                                <li>as an immigrant, Jack is familiar with and willing to make significant lifestyle changes</li>
                                <li>Jack is an advocate of civil rights, same sex marriage, abortion, and legalized marijuana</li>
                            </ul>
                        There are about 4 months left until Jack runs out of money, so please, give them a job.
